# Why?
I began using Arch (btw) recently and while it has a ton of tools available to configure the system, there is no such thing as a tool for editing env variables "quickly" (by quickly, i mean not needing me to manually go to the file and edit it myself). So I made this tool to do just that. 
I game on Linux and one of the first things i had to do was set up an env variable to give my GPU a bigger shader cache, and found it a bit tedious to do it manually. Call it laziness if you want, I just wanted a quick way to do it and I hope this tool can help you as well.

In memory of my aunt's late dog, Archie.
